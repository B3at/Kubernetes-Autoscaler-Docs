# Kubernetes Autoscaler Comparison

This is the repository of the Kubernetes Autoscaler Comparison webpage, created in a Bachelor Research Project at the [Software Quality and Architecture] institute at the [University of Stuttgart] by Andrey Larionov, Nicolas Caycedo and Pascal Joos.  

The webpage is accessable at [https://b3at.github.io/Kubernetes-Autoscaler-Docs/].

## Building and previewing the site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
